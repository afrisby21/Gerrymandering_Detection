# Gerrymandering_Detection
Gerrymandering is an issue of paramount importance in several
parts of the world, particularly in the US, and has been the subject
not only of a significant amount of literature, but also of recent
Supreme Court cases and official redistrict plans. It poses a great
threat to democracy, and the need for the development of appro-
priate detecting and preventing measures is evident. In this paper,
we employ machine learning as a predicting measure for gerry-
mandering. In particular, via combining appropriate image district
data and their associated demographic data, we train deep learning
models that are able to detect gerrymandered districts with rather
high accuracy. Our results show for the first time the potential
effectiveness of deep learning as a tool against gerrymandering,
and opens up avenues for further investigations.
