# Gerrymandering_Detection
Gerrymandering in the U.S. is an issue that remains difficult to define and categorize due to
its subjectivity, which has been highlighted in recent Supreme Court cases and redistrictings. This
dissertation provides a proof of concept for machine learning models that detect and predict
gerrymandering in a U.S. congressional district. Combining generated image data of districts with
their numerical, demographic data mixed models with convolutional, dense, and concatenation
layers are produced. Data is then labeled using a wide range of metrics and supplied to the models
for training. The predictive output is binary for most models tested; however, a multiclass model is
explored as well. Many parameters, metrics, and research questions were assessed and compared to
achieve the best test accuracy. The highest accuracy achieved was 86%, which was an encouraging
result for a foundational research project and proved that a machine learning model could be
leveraged to detect, analyze, and quantify gerrymandering.
